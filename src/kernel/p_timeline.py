    """Class for a simulation timeline with parallel computation.

    The Parallel Timeline acts behaves similarly to the Timeline class, maintianing and executing a queue of events.
    There is one Parallel Timeline per simulation process.
    Each timeline controls a subset of the simulated network nodes.
    For events executed on nodes belonging to other timelines, an event buffer is maintained.
    These buffers are exchanged between timelines at regular synchronization intervals.
    All Parallel Timelines in a simulation communicate with a Quantum Manager Server for shared quantum states.

    Attributes:
        id (int): rank of MPI process running the Parallel Timeline instance.
        foreign_entities (Dict[str, int]): mapping of object names on other processes to process id.
        event_buffer(List[List[Event]]): stores events for execution on foreign entities; swapped during synchronization.
        lookahead (int): defines width of time window for execution (simulation time between synchronization).
        quantum_manager (QuantumManagerClient): local quantum manager client to communicate with server.
