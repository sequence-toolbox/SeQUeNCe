    "- `QuantumChannel` and `ClassicalChannel` are communication links between quantum nodes, providing models of optical fibers.\n",
    "- The `Rule` class is used to direct the behavior of protocols within the simulation by providing explicit steps to be taken. Rules include a condition that must be met by a router and the action that should be performed when the condition is met.\n",
    "- The `EntanglementGenerationA` is our implementation of the Barrett-Kok protocol and is used in defining rules for this simulation."

In SeQUeNCe, rules define a **condition** under which the rule is satisfied and an **action** that should be performed by a node's Resource Management module when the condition is met. More details are available in the documentation on rules, but we implement the basics here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule condition we define simply requires a memory to be in the `RAW` state, that is, not occupied by a protocol or entangled with another memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule action differs between the two router nodes in the network. On the first node, a memory that meets our condition is given to an `EntanglementGenerationA` instance to begin entanglement. The action returns this protocol as well as a requirement of the other router -- that it also has an `EntanglementGenerationA` protocol to pair to. On the second router, the protocol is simply created and returned by the action."

Several elements of SeQUeNCe, including the Resource Management module, automatically collect simple metrics such as entanglement time. For custom or more advanced metrics, custom code may need to be written and applied. See the documentation for a list of metrics provided by default for each simulation tool."
