### Jupyter Notebook Examples
The example folder contains several scripts that can be run with jupyter notebook for easy editing and visualization. These examples include:
* `two_node_eg.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation between two adjacent quantum routers
* `three_node_eg_ep_es.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation, purification, and swapping for a linear network of three quantum routers
* `random_request_network.ipynb`, demonstrate the simulation of a more complicated network topology with randomized applications
* `teleport_2nodes.ipynb`, demonstrate the simulation of the teleportation application.
