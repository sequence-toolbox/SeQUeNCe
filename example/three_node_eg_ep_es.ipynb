    "# Three Node Entanglement Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "For metropolitan-scale quantum networks to be usable, performing entanglement generation alone is insufficient. Addtionally, mannually adding rules is not a scalable way to configure network. As such, we must add protocols to purify and swap the generated entanglements. Rules about these protocols are created and installed automatically by the network manager. We then have a roughly three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate entanglement between quantum memory pairs on adjacent nodes\n",
    "2. Consume several entangled pairs to produce a single, high-fidelity entangled pairs\n",
    "3. \"Swap\" the entanglement of two memory pairs, consuming the two shorter-distance entanglements to produce one at a greater distance\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps may be repeated several times to achieve entanglement over a large distance or a large number of nodes. In this file, we use SeQUeNCe to simulate entanglement distribution between three linear network nodes. Entanglement generation, purification, and swapping protocols are used. The network topology is shown below:\n",

This node uses Bell state measurement to generate entanglement between routers.\n",
    "- `QuantumChannel` and `ClassicalChannel` are communication links between quantum nodes, providing models of optical fibers."

    "    - This includes adjustment of default hardware parameters, as necessary\n",
    "    - This also includes creation of a static routing table for entanglement paths\n",
    "3. Instantiate custom protocols and ensure all protocols are set up (paired) properly (if necessary)\n",
    "4. Initialize and run the simulation\n",
    "5. Collect and display the desired metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the desired metric is the number of completed entanglements over time and their fidelities. Several elements of SeQUeNCe, including the Resource Management module, automatically collect simple metrics such as these. For custom or more advanced metrics, custom code may need to be written and applied. See the documentation for a list of metrics provided by default for each simulation tool."
