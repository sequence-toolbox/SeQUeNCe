    "# Quantum Key Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum key distribution is the process of distributing cryptographic keys between parties using quantum methods. Due to the unique properties of quantum information compared to classical, the security of a key can be guarunteed (as any unwelcomed measurement would change the state of quantum information transmitted).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file, we see the use of SeQUeNCe to simulate quantum key distribution between two adjacent nodes. The first example demonstrates key distribution alone (using the BB84 protocol), while the second example demonstrates additional error correction with the cascade protocol. The network topology, including hardware components, is shown below:\n",

    "### Control and Collecting Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Several elements of SeQUeNCe automatically collect simple metrics. This includes the BB84 protocol implementation, which collects key error rates, throughput, and latency. For custom or more advanced metrics, custom code may need to be written and applied. See the documentation for a list of metrics provided by default for each simulation tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we create a `KeyManager` class to collect a custom metric (in this case, simply collect all of the generated keys and their generation time) and to provide an interface for the BB84 Protocol. To achieve this, we use the `push` and `pop` functions provided by the protocol stack on QKD nodes. `push` is used to send information down the stack (from the key manager to BB84 in this example) while `pop` is used to send information upwards (from BB84 to the key manager). Different protocols may use these interfaces for different data but only BB84 is shown in this example."
