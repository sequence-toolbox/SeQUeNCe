# Chapter 5: Network Manager

In this tutorial, we will showcase the Network Management module of SeQUeNCe and show its operation on a typical network. The goal of this tutorial is to
- Gain familiarity with the `network_management` module
- Gain familiarity with the `topology.topology` module
- Using external files to build networks

To achieve this, we will be using an example json file to build our network and will use the network manager on `QuantumRouter` nodes to request entanglement pairs. The json file will create the network topology shown below:

![topo](figures/star_network.png)

This example is similar to the example jupyter notebook script `random_request_network.ipynb`, without applications and with slightly different parameters. The notebook can be viewed in the `example` directory of the SeQUeNCe download, including already written code and interactive input.

### Background

The Network Management module of sequence is responsible for coordinating the protocols of network nodes, ensuring the proper and efficient completion of application requests. This is done with an internal protocol stack, as shown below:

![nm](figures/net_manager.png)

When a request is received, the network manager with first push a message to the **reservation** protocol, which determines if the request can be met on the local node. If so, the protocol reserves hardware resources and passes the request to the **routing** protocol, which determines the next router in an optimal path between the requested nodes (this optimal path is determined when building the topology by finding the shortest quantum connection path between nodes). Nodes in the path receive reservation requests and either reserve local resources or reject the request. If rejected on any node or accepted by all nodes, the request is sent back to the originating node by the reverse path. If accepted, appropriate rules are automatically generated and installed in the resource manager as well.

When constructing the network manager, the `NewNetworkManager` function of the `sequence.network_management.network_manager` module is used. This function will automatically create the default reservation and routing protocol stack and install it into the network manager.

```python
def NewNetworkManager(owner: "QuantumRouter") -> "NetworkManager":
    manager = NetworkManager(owner, [])
    routing = StaticRoutingProtocol(owner, owner.name + ".StaticRoutingProtocol", {})
    rsvp = ResourceReservationProtocol(owner, owner.name + ".RSVP")
    routing.upper_protocols.append(rsvp)
    rsvp.lower_protocols.append(routing)
    manager.load_stack([routing, rsvp])
    return manager
```

### Step 1: Create the Network Configuration File

For this example, we will be using a json file to specify the nodes and connectivity of the network.
The json file should be structured as a dictionary with the following keys:

- `is_parallel`, denoting if it's a parallel or sequential simulation
- `stop_time`, the stop time of simulation
- `nodes`, giving a list of node specifications
- At least one of the following:
  - `qchannels`, giving a list of quantum channel specifications
  - `qconnections`, giving a list of two-way quantum connection specifications
- At least one of the following:
  - `cchannels`, giving a list of classical channel specifications (similar to `qchannels`)
  - `cconnections`, giving a list of two-way classical connection specifications

For this simulation, we use sequential simulation to simulate 2 seconds of the network.

```json
"is_parallel": false,
"stop_time": 2000000000000
```

Next, we will make the `nodes` entry.
All fields of the list will have the `name` field required by the node constructor and a specification of the node type,
along with any more arguments (optional or not) specified by the specific node type.
We will be using the `QuantumRouter` node type for this tutorial,
which already includes all of the necessary hardware for entanglement distribution as well as all necessary modules (including network management).
The `seed` attribute denotes the random seed used for the random number generator on the node,
which can guarantee the reproducibility of the simulation.
The `memo_size` attribute defines the size of the memory array on the quantum router.

```json
"nodes": [
  {
    "name": "center",
    "type": "QuantumRouter",
    "seed": 0,
    "memo_size": 50
  },
  {
    "name": "end1",
    "type": "QuantumRouter",
    "seed": 1
    "memo_size": 50,
  },
  {
    "name": "end2",
    "type": "QuantumRouter",
    "seed": 2
    "memo_size": 50,
  },
  {
    "name": "end3",
    "type": "QuantumRouter",
    "seed": 3
    "memo_size": 50,
  },
  {
    "name": "end4",
    "type": "QuantumRouter",
    "seed": 4
    "memo_size": 50,
  }
]
```

The `qconnections` entry should have multiple entries specifying the name of the two connected nodes and at least the attenuation and length of the fiber
(plus any additional keyword arguments).
The type of quantum connection should be specified by the attribute `type`.
Here, we use the predefined type `meet_in_the_middle`  that automatically generates a BSM node in the middle of node1 and node2.

```json
"qconnections": [
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end1",
      "attenuation": 0.0002,
      "distance": 500,
      "type": "meet_in_the_middle"
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end2",
      "attenuation": 0.0002,
      "distance": 500,
      "type": "meet_in_the_middle"
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end3",
      "attenuation": 0.0002,
      "distance": 500,
      "type": "meet_in_the_middle"
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end4",
      "attenuation": 0.0002,
      "distance": 500,
      "type": "meet_in_the_middle"
    }
]
```

Finally, for the classical channels, we will specify two-way `cconnections`.
The node endpoints are specified by name as `node1` and `node2`, and each communication direction will have the same delay `delay`.

```json
"cconnections": [
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end1",
      "delay": 500000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end2",
      "delay": 500000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end3",
      "delay": 500000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "center",
      "node2": "end4",
      "delay": 500000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end1",
      "node2": "end2",
      "delay": 1000000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end1",
      "node2": "end3",
      "delay": 1000000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end1",
      "node2": "end4",
      "delay": 1000000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end2",
      "node2": "end3",
      "delay": 1000000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end2",
      "node2": "end4",
      "delay": 1000000000
    },
    {
      "node1": "end3",
      "node2": "end4",
      "delay": 1000000000
    }
]
```

### Step 2: Build the Network

Now, we can move to our script and begin building the experiment from our json file.
The json file can be loaded with the construction function of `RouterNetTopo`.
Note that we have the json file saved as `star_network.json` here.
The `RouterNetTopo` will also create a timeline with 2 seconds of simulation time.
We use the function `get_timeline()` to get the timeline for the simulation.

```python
from sequence.topology.router_net_topo import RouterNetTopo


network_config = "star_network.json"
network_topo = RouterNetTopo(network_config)
tl = network_topo.get_timeline()
```

To edit network parameters quickly, we can define a custom function to interact with the topology. This function will take one argument:
- `topology`, the `RouterNetTopo` object we wish to update.

We will edit a few hardware objects by accessing the hardware fields of network nodes. To access all nodes of a specific type in the network, we can use the `topology.get_nodes_by_type` method. This is useful for editing hardware objects that may only be found on one node type, e.g. memories only found on `QuantumRouter` nodes.

We may also wish to edit parameters of our entanglement protocols.
Since these are created by a node's resource manager,
we will need to edit the appropriate fields of the resource manager on each node.
This is achieved in much the same way as hardware elements.

For quantum and classical connections, the `get_qchannels` and `get_cchannels`  functions of the topology will return a  list of quantum channels and classical channels, respectively.
These provide an iterable list of all connections in the network that may be edited directly.

```python
def set_parameters(topology: RouterNetTopo):
    # set memories parameters
    MEMO_FREQ = 2e3
    MEMO_EXPIRE = 0
    MEMO_EFFICIENCY = 1
    MEMO_FIDELITY = 0.9349367588934053
    for node in topology.get_nodes_by_type(RouterNetTopo.QUANTUM_ROUTER):
        memory_array = node.get_components_by_type("MemoryArray")[0]
        memory_array.update_memory_params("frequency", MEMO_FREQ)
        memory_array.update_memory_params("coherence_time", MEMO_EXPIRE)
        memory_array.update_memory_params("efficiency", MEMO_EFFICIENCY)
        memory_array.update_memory_params("raw_fidelity", MEMO_FIDELITY)

    # set detector parameters
    DETECTOR_EFFICIENCY = 0.9
    DETECTOR_COUNT_RATE = 5e7
    DETECTOR_RESOLUTION = 100
    for node in topology.get_nodes_by_type(RouterNetTopo.BSM_NODE):
        bsm = node.get_components_by_type("SingleAtomBSM")[0]
        bsm.update_detectors_params("efficiency", DETECTOR_EFFICIENCY)
        bsm.update_detectors_params("count_rate", DETECTOR_COUNT_RATE)
        bsm.update_detectors_params("time_resolution", DETECTOR_RESOLUTION)
    # set entanglement swapping parameters
    SWAP_SUCC_PROB = 0.90
    SWAP_DEGRADATION = 0.99
    for node in topology.get_nodes_by_type(RouterNetTopo.QUANTUM_ROUTER):
        node.network_manager.protocol_stack[1].set_swapping_success_rate(SWAP_SUCC_PROB)
        node.network_manager.protocol_stack[1].set_swapping_degradation(SWAP_DEGRADATION)
        
    # set quantum channel parameters
    ATTENUATION = 1e-5
    QC_FREQ = 1e11
    for qc in topology.get_qchannels():
        qc.attenuation = ATTENUATION
        qc.frequency = QC_FREQ
```

We can then insert this into our script and call our function with the `network_topo` object:

```python
set_parameters(network_topo)
```

### Step 3: Making Requests

With the network built, we are now ready to make requests of the network manager and start entanglement. The `request` method of the network manager can be used for this. When invoked, it will automatically start the reservation process and create rules as required (see the background section). The method has 5 arguments:
- `responder`, a string name of the other node with which to generate entangled pairs
- `start_time`, the simulation time (in **picoseconds**) at which entanglement should begin
- `end_time`, the simulation time at which entanglement may end and reserved resources released
- `memory_size`, the number of entangled memory pairs requested
- `target_fidelity`, the desired fidelity of entanglement for all pairs

We will make one request at one network node, asking for 25 memories to be entangled starting at 1 second and ending at 2 seconds (the end of our simulation). At the end of the simulation we will print out the entanglement state of memories in a manner similar to chapter 4.

```python
# the start and end nodes may be edited as desired 
start_node_name = "end1"
end_node_name = "end2"
node1 = node2 = None

for router in network_topo.get_nodes_by_type(RouterNetTopo.QUANTUM_ROUTER):
    if router.name == start_node_name:
        node1 = router
    elif router.name == end_node_name:
        node2 = router

nm = node1.network_manager
nm.request(end_node_name, start_time=1e12, end_time=10e12, memory_size=25, target_fidelity=0.9)

tl.init()
tl.run()

print(node1, "memories")
print("Index:\tEntangled Node:\tFidelity:\tEntanglement Time:")
for info in node1.resource_manager.memory_manager:
		print("{:6}\t{:15}\t{:9}\t{}".format(str(info.index),
                                         str(info.remote_node),
                                         str(info.fidelity),
                                         str(info.entangle_time * 1e-12)))
```

We should notice that all memories are entangled with the specified distant node, that they have fidelity above our specified threshold, and that the entangled time is between 1 and 2 seconds.
