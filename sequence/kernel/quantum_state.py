"""Definition of the quantum state classes.

This module defines the classes used to track quantum states in SeQUeNCe.
These include 2 classes used by a quantum manager, and one used for individual photons:

1. The `KetState` class represents the ket vector formalism and is used by a quantum manager.
2. The `DensityState` class represents the density matrix formalism and is also used by a quantum manager.
3. The `FreeQuantumState` class uses the ket vector formalism, and is used by individual photons (not the quantum manager).
